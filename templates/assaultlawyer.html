<h1 class=orange>Assault Lawyer</h1>
<h3>$10 a day</h3>
<p> I am a criminal lawyer serving clients accused of assault in Toronto, Brampton, Mississauga and the surrounding area</p>
<p>I fight assault charges for $10 a day.  To be eligible you must meet the following requirements:<br/>
<p>1. The assault must not involve a firearm;<br/>
<p>2. The assault must not have caused serious or permanent injury; and,<br/>
<p>3. You must not be too close to the day of trial</p>
<br/>
<h3>Charges Gone Quickly</h3>
<p>If no weapon is used and the assault was minor, assault and domestic assault charges can usually be dropped with a 
diversion or a discharge. &nbsp; More serious assault charges can also sometimes be dropped with a discharge depending on 
the circumstances.  Getting diversion or a discharge means that there will be no criminal conviction on your record.</p>
<p>I work to set meetings with prosecutors as soon as possible and negotiate as hard as possible to get your charges dropped 
    as quickly as possible. &nbsp; If a trial is required I go over all the evidence with you before going to court.  &nbsp; You can rest assured 
    that you are getting the best possible representation and that your side of the story will be heard.
